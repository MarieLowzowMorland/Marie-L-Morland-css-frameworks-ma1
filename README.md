Practice creating page layouts using Bootstrap and Sass.

Some reflections after my first experience with Bootstrap and scss:

I understand and see the benefits of standardizing code and using a shared library. It will be easier to collaborate on the code and still have an overview of css. And if you are going to pass the project on to someone else, it will be easy to understand the code. In addition, it becomes easier to reuse components and templates as the code follows the same pattern.

With this in mind, I first loaded all the scss code from bootstrap in the hope of getting to know it a bit and for example changing the variables on colors instead of adding new code.

Although it went well to change the colors, I got bigger challenges on layout. I experienced that I had to struggle a bit with where the rules were actually located. I thought I could add a rule to a class, and then it turned out that there were more specific rules that came into play when several classes were gathered. Then it became much easier to just add a new class. It may be my lack of experience, but I found it difficult to understand the system. And since my computer made a lot of noise while working on all these files, I ended up linking to bootstrap - css in html instead, creating new classes and rules that override existing ones rather than changing them.
